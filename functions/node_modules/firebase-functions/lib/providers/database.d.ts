/**
 * Handle events at a Firebase Realtime Database Reference.
 *
 * This method behaves very similarly to the method of the same name in the
 * client and Admin Firebase SDKs. Any change to the Database that affects the
 * data at or below the provided `path` will fire an event in Cloud Functions.
 *
 * There are three important differences between listening to a Realtime
 * Database event in Cloud Functions and using the Realtime Database in the
 * client and Admin SDKs:
 * 1. Cloud Functions allows wildcards in the `path` name. Any `path` component
 *    in curly brackets (`{}`) is a wildcard that matches all strings. The value
 *    that matched a certain invocation of a Cloud Function is returned as part
 *    of the `event.params` object. For example, `ref("messages/{messageId}")`
 *    matches changes at `/messages/message1` or `/messages/message2`, resulting
 *    in  `event.params.messageId` being set to `"message1"` or `"message2"`,
 *    respectively.
 * 2. Cloud Functions do not fire an event for data that already existed before
 *    the Cloud Function was deployed.
 * 3. Cloud Function events have access to more information, including a
 *    snapshot of the previous event data and information about the user who
 *    triggered the Cloud Function.
