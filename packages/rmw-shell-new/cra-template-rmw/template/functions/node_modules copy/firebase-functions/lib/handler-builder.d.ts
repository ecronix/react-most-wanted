         * There are three important differences between listening to a Realtime
         * Database event in Cloud Functions and using the Realtime Database in the
         * client and Admin SDKs:
         * 1. Cloud Functions allows wildcards in the `path` name. Any `path` component
         *    in curly brackets (`{}`) is a wildcard that matches all strings. The value
         *    that matched a certain invocation of a Cloud Function is returned as part
         *    of the `context.params` object. For example, `ref("messages/{messageId}")`
         *    matches changes at `/messages/message1` or `/messages/message2`, resulting
         *    in  `context.params.messageId` being set to `"message1"` or `"message2"`,
         *    respectively.
         * 2. Cloud Functions do not fire an event for data that already existed before
         *    the Cloud Function was deployed.
         * 3. Cloud Function events have access to more information, including information
         *    about the user who triggered the Cloud Function.
