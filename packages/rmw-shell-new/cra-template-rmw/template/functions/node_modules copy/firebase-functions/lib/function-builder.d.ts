         * There are three important differences between listening to a Realtime
         * Database event in Cloud Functions and using the Realtime Database in
         * the client and Admin SDKs:
         * 1. Cloud Functions allows wildcards in the `path` name. Any `path`
         *    component in curly brackets (`{}`) is a wildcard that matches all
         *    strings. The value that matched a certain invocation of a Cloud
         *    Function is returned as part of the `context.params` object. For
         *    example, `ref("messages/{messageId}")` matches changes at
         *    `/messages/message1` or `/messages/message2`, resulting in
         *    `context.params.messageId` being set to `"message1"` or
         *    `"message2"`, respectively.
         * 2. Cloud Functions do not fire an event for data that already existed
         *    before the Cloud Function was deployed.
         * 3. Cloud Function events have access to more information, including
         *    information about the user who triggered the Cloud Function.
