      * to the callback will be for the location at which `on()` was called. It

      * and it will be triggered again every time a new child is added. The
      * `DataSnapshot` passed into the callback will reflect the data for the

      * (or `null` if it is the first child).

      * <h4>child_removed event</h4>
      *
      * This event will be triggered once every time a child is removed. The
      * `DataSnapshot` passed into the callback will be the old data for the child
      * that was removed. A child will get removed when either:
      *
      * - a client explicitly calls `remove()` on that child or one of its ancestors
      * - a client calls `set(null)` on that child or one of its ancestors
      * - that child has all of its children removed
      * - there is a query in effect which now filters out the child (because it's

      *
      * This event will be triggered when the data stored in a child (or any of its
      * descendants) changes. Note that a single `child_changed` event may represent
      * multiple changes to the child. The `DataSnapshot` passed to the callback will
      * contain the new child contents. For ordering purposes, the callback is also
      * passed a second argument which is a string containing the key of the previous
      * sibling child by sort order (or `null` if it is the first child).
      *
      * <h4>child_moved event</h4>
      *
      * This event will be triggered when a child's sort order changes such that its
      * position relative to its siblings changes. The `DataSnapshot` passed to the
      * callback will be for the data of the child that has moved. It is also passed
      * a second argument which is a string containing the key of the previous
      * sibling child by sort order (or `null` if it is the first child).
